Hello!
Planning is underway for the 2021 edition of the Digi-Key Collegiate Computing Competition (DKC3). This is an exciting opportunity for students to test their problem solving skills along with their programming prowess.  Your university and department are invited to participate in this event on October 15, 2021. 
We are inviting your department to bring Two teams of four competitors.  Competitors must be students of junior or senior level majoring in the department their team represents. Please ensure all team members meet the eligibility requirements as stated in the competition rules. Any team that does not follow competition rules will be disqualified. It is highly encouraged that a faculty member accompanies teams that represent their department. Complete competition details, including rules, itinerary, and problems from DKC3 2020 will be available soon on our website:

Due to the Covid-19 situation we’ll be conducting the competition on-line this year instead of on-site at Digi-Key Corporation.
